# The Matrix

## What You Think Is You Might Just Be Programming

Your thoughts aren't always your own. They're often echoes of:
- What your parents believed
- What your teachers taught
- What your friends valued
- What society expects

## Class, Comparison, and Consciousness

We're taught to compare ourselves to others, but what if the comparison itself is part of the program?

## The Moment You See Another World

Like when I discovered Amalfi wasn't just a neighborhoodâ€”it was a whole other way of living. A whole other possibility.

## It's Not About Shame. It's About Seeing More.

The goal isn't to feel bad about what you didn't know. It's to recognize that there's always more to learn, more to see, more to become.

## Are You Still Playing Someone Else's Game?
