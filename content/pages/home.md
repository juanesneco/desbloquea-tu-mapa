# You were handed a map. You didn't draw it. Let's change that.

## Your First Map

Childhood wasn't just a time. It was a set of coordinates. The hot dogs. The bikes. The gray houses. The idea of luxury.
You lived inside a world defined by what you could see. But what if there's more?

## The Matrix Is Real — But So Is the Exit

The Matrix isn't a sci-fi movie. It's the belief that life just happens to you. But life is a game—and once you learn the controls, you can start playing on your own terms.

## Why Unlock Your Map?

Because you're not here to just repeat the patterns you were given.
Because you're allowed to grow past your zip code, your past, and your programming.
