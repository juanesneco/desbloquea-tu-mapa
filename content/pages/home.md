# You were born into a world you didn't choose.

You are here to find your way out. Welcome to your map.

## What is Unlock Your Map?

Unlock Your Map is not a course, nor a social network.
It's a journey — through ideas, questions, and awakenings.
You will explore a map that reveals your hidden roles, beliefs, and attachments.
The final mission is simple: Win the game by becoming free of it.
Your only travel companions: Curiosity. Honesty. Courage.
