# The Storyteller

I'm not a guru. I'm not a coach. I'm just a guy who noticed the patterns.

## The Patterns

I noticed how:
- Our childhood experiences shape our adult expectations
- Our beliefs about what's possible are often inherited, not chosen
- We can get stuck playing someone else's game without realizing it

## The Change

I changed my mindset by:
- Questioning my assumptions
- Seeking out different perspectives
- Practicing new ways of thinking
- Building tools to help others do the same

## The Tools

What started as personal exploration became a framework for others:
- The childhood map exercise
- The game metaphor
- The matrix concept
- The practice of intentional living

## The Invitation

This isn't about following my path. It's about finding your own.
