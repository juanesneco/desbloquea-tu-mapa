# What is Unlock Your Map?

Unlock Your Map is a personal journey to awaken your true potential.

You will move through reflections, ideas, and realizations inside a fictional city that represents your mind.

Your mission is not to master the game, but to become free from it.

## The Journey

1. **Anonymous Exploration**
   - No names, no profiles
   - Just you and your thoughts
   - A unique identity code for your journey

2. **Mission-Based Discovery**
   - Seven missions to complete
   - Each reveals a new layer of reality
   - Progress through deep reflection

3. **The Final Realization**
   - The game is not about winning
   - It's about becoming free
   - Remembering who you truly are

## The Essence

This is not a social network.
This is not a traditional course.
This is a space for awakening.

A place where minds meet minds,
not personalities meeting personalities.
A space for truth seekers.

Welcome to your map.
