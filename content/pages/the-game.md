# The Game

## You're Not Bad at Life—You Just Didn't Get the Manual

Life doesn't come with instructions. But that doesn't mean you're playing it wrong. It just means you're learning as you go.

## GTA & SIMS: What They Got Right

In video games, you understand that:
- You can upgrade your character
- You can learn new skills
- You can explore new areas
- You can make different choices

Life works the same way.

## Learning the Controls: Awareness, Intention, Execution

### Awareness
Notice what's happening around you. What patterns do you see? What rules are you following without realizing it?

### Intention
Decide where you want to go. What kind of character do you want to be? What skills do you want to develop?

### Execution
Take action. Try new things. Make mistakes. Learn. Level up.

## Upgrade Your Character

### Health
Your body is your avatar. How are you maintaining it?

### Money
It's not about greed—it's about having the resources to play the game you want to play.

### Relationships
The people around you are your party members. Choose them wisely.

### Joy
This is your XP bar. Are you filling it up?

## Interactive: Which buttons are you not using yet?
